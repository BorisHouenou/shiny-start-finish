## Debugging

Basic methods:

1. Add `message()`
2. Add `browser()` (within a reactive  or observer in the server function)
3. Put a breakpoint (within  a reactive or observer)

## More advanced

- [display objects in a tab](https://github.com/daattali/advanced-shiny/tree/master/debug-value)

- put a command input in your app, evaluating it in the server and displaying the result.

- putting a console in your app! shinyjs::runcode, but see [this github  site](https://github.com/daattali/advanced-shiny/blob/master/run-arbitrary-code/app.R) for the actual code, so that you can display the output in a text field.

NEED TO  MAKE A NICE EXAMPLE, where a connection is not being made. Maybe Pythagorus, but where we forgot to connect to B.
