You'll need ...

1. A **development** machine/server: RStudio
2. A Shiny **server**

## Development organization

When running R on your own machine, the computer serving your app is your server.

Almost all  your time will be spent in this configuration, but it is exceptional.

## Deployed app organization

Your development machine is not in the picture.

## Set up your development server now

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
Strongly recommended ... RStudio.cloud

<div class="col">
If you must use your own machine ...

- Make a new project from <https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/shiny-start-finish>
- Be prepared to install packages. See `Packages-installed.R` in root directory of project.

Navigate to `Projects/Project-1/app.R` NEED TO UPDATE?, open in editor, and run.

## Now, set up your **deployment** server

If you already have a Shiny server available, you can use that.

Otherwise ...
