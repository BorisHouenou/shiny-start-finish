## Project 1 

*Remember, our first project was "Project 0". Now we're on to the real projects!*

Go to `Projects/Project-1-build-UI/`

## Add UI inputs

Edit `UI_starting.R` to add several of these widgets to your UI. Have fun with the choices. You can see code examples at [https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html)

- actionLink
- checkboxInput
- checkboxGroupInput
- radioButtons
- passwordInput
- textInput

Verify that the UI works. How? Run the `app.R` file.

## Display UI input values

Preface: The `glue()` function is a nice way to embed values in strings.
```{r}
glue::glue("The value of 3 + 7 is {3+7}.")
```

**TASK**: Add an element to your server to display in `output$felix` a string with the values of the UI inputs you added. # Project 1
