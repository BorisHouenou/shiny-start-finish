## Schedule

The workshop will be a mix:

1. Me talking and you asking questions or observations.
2. Activities, called "**Your turn**"
    a. Questions for you to figure out
    b. Systems for you to design
    c. **Demos** that you run, but don't alter.
    d. **Projects**, which are like demos, but you alter/fix them. 

As you undertake activites, please:

- engage your neighbors in them
- pull in a TA (or me) to the discussion
