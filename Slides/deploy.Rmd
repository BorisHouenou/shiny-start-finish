## Get your directory in order

1. Name of directory will be the name of the app
2. The call to `shinyApp()` should be in a script `app.R`.
3. Any other files used in the app should be:
    a. a package that can be installed on the server
    b. the app directory or subdirectories of it
    c. available via the web
    d. uploadable to app


## Some server options ...

1. Your institutional RStudio server may already be set up for deploying apps.
2. Create your own server on [DigitalOcean](https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/)
3. Use <shinyapps.io>

## Setting up a <shinyapps.io> account

- This is what I use, which is probably only a testament to how little systems skills are needed.
- First level account is free.

## Deploying from RStudio
