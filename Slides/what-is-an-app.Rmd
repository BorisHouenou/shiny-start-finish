## Every Shiny App is a webpage

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
![](images/app-is-webpage.png)
</div>
<div class="col2">
**Included in the webpage:**

a. HTML & CSS
b. JavaScript

**Behind the webpage:**

a. An R session (on a computer)
b. (optionally) Persistent storage
</div>
</div>

## Creating an App involves {style="margin:0px;font-size:80%;"}

**Behind the scenes**

1. Write basic software to make graphs, access persistent storage, ...

**From RStudio**

2. Construct a user interface with Shiny functions
3. Connect (1) to (2) with **reactive logic**

**Deployment to server**

Usually this is semi-automatic.

In this workshop, you'll use ...

- shinyapps.io
- RStudio Connect

## A metaphor ... *The Wizarding World*

Two kinds of programming worlds in a Shiny app:

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
1. **Muggle** world. 
    - ordinary R programming: functions, packages, ...
</div>
<div class="col">
2. **Wizard** world.
    - reactives 
    - functions without arguments
    - values that can't be changed by normal assignment `<-`
    - packaged in a "server" function (usually)
</div>
</div>
    
The wizard world can reach out to the Muggle world ... but not *vice versa*.
