## Dashboards

```{r include=TRUE}
library(flexdashboard)
```

I'll approach this from the perspective of making a small display for a phone. That means a display less than 768 pixels in height.

In Chrome,  CMD-OPT-I brings up the console.

## Value boxes

```{r eval = FALSE}
spam <- 17
valueBox(
  spam, icon = "fa-trash",
  color = ifelse(spam > 10, "warning", "primary")
)
```

## Flexdashboard

- More or less ordinary document

- Columns denoted by level-2 header
    - Use `{data-width=650}` directives to set width
- Items in column by level-3 header
