<strong>Model Functions <em>Little App</em></strong>
<br>
In this app, you select a response variable and an explanatory variable, 
as well as (optionally) a covariate.
<br>
The app automatically builds a model of  the response variable
in terms of the explanatory variable and covariate (if any).  The model
is displayed along with the data.
<br><br>
The buttons near the top of the app allow you to set sample size 
and the <em>flexibility</em> of the model. In addition ...
<ul>
<li>The <strong>freeze</strong> button keeps a snapshot of currently displayed
data and model. You can  see the snapshot in the <em>Compare</em> tab. The snapshot
stays put until  the next time you press 'freeze'.</li>
<li>When on, the <strong>randomize</strong> switch will randomly scramble
the response variable with  respect to the explanatory variables, creating a 
situation where there is no relationship between  the two. Any relationship
that appears is due merely to the play of chance.</li>
<li>The <strong>New Sample</strong> button chooses a new sample at random from 
the whole set of available data. This allows you to explore sampling variability.</li>
<li>
</ul>


The icons at the bottom  of the app take you to different tabs.
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Data</strong> tab is used to  select  a data set and variables. It also shows 
a small, preview  copy of the current graph. Note: Until you select a data set
and variables, all the other displays will be blank.</li>
<li>The <strong>Larger Graph</strong> tab shows the current graphic at a bigger
size than in the Data tab.</li> 
<li>The <strong>Compare</strong> tab shows the current plot  and the frozen snapshot
side by side.</li>
<li>The <strong>Inference</strong> tab shows statistical reports for the 
current model and the frozen model (if any). Note that you can use <em>new sample</em> and
<em>randomize</em> to look at variation in the model statistics.
<li>The <strong>Metadata</strong> tab shows the codebook for the currently selected
data frame.</li>
</ul>
